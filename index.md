We extend a warm welcome to RUN WITH SAI.

**Run With Sai** originally started as a **"Charity Run With Sai" 2408 KM** across Cambodia, an initiative of one person, with the support of everyone who shared the same aim for a good course together. That’s how we came together as a group—Run With Sai, also known as Sai Force—to organize running events at heritage sites and local destinations in Cambodia. Our goal is to introduce both local and international runners to experience the beautiful places of Cambodia.

"It just needs one person to start and with support from everyone who has the same aim
for a good course." <span style="color: red;">**- SAI founder**</span>



"ចាប់ផ្ដើមពីមនុស្សម្នាក់ មានការគាំទ្រពីអ្នករាល់គ្នា ដែលមានបំណងរួមគ្នា
ដើម្បីសម្រេចរឿងល្អជាមួយគ្នា។" <span style="color: red;">**- SAI**</span>
