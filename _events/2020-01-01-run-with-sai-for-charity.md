Run for Charity with Sai was an impact footprint community project, initially by an enthusiastic runner, Sai, to celebrate his 30th birthday and give back to the community by running across Cambodia for fundraising to help children at Angkor Hospital for Children. He committed to work on this project with two main goals. First of all, expect to raise funds for Angkor Hospital for Children for one thousand million riels. The project has been done successfully by raising double the number of the goal with a total amount of two thousand million riels from people across Cambodia. With this amount of funds, Angkor Hospital for Children could help more than 10,000 cases. Another big goal that Sai aimed is to inspire young Cambodian youth to start taking action to contribute back to our society. The project also has moved so many hearts from young to old people across the country.

**Total fundraising: 500,000 USD.**
