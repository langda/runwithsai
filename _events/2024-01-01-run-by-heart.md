RUN BY HEART was the running for charity campaign which is created to raise donations for charity and to promote healthcare through running. All proceeds from the registration run will be donated to the Rabbit School, a school for the care and training of children with autism. We believe that this event will also play a role in building the mindset of unity and social contribution.

- Total fundraising: 9,318.65 USD (03.02.2025)
- 500 participants included 111 autistic students from Rabbit 26 teachers, 101 parents, 200 donations, 18 UYFC members, partners, sponsors, and the Run With Sai team.
