**RUN BY HEART** is a charity running campaign created to raise donations for charity and promote healthcare through running. This is the second edition, which will take place on May 31, 2025, at the Olympic National Stadium.

All proceeds from the registration fees will be donated to Rabbit School, a school dedicated to the care and training of children with autism. We believe that this event will also play a role in fostering a mindset of unity and social contribution.

**Our fundraising goal: $30,000.**
