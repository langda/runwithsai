 **"PREAH VIHEAR TEMPLE RUN"** was the second edition of a running event that took place on **July 7, 2023** in the area of **Preah Vihear Temple, Preah Vihear Province**.
 
The running was opened for **Public Registration** to run through, visit the **Preah Vihear temple**, and celebrate the **16th anniversary** of the inscription of the Temple of Preah Vihear on the World Heritage List (July 7, 2008 - July 7, 2024), and run on the ancient road, accompanied by ancient infrastructure.

We arranged performances of Khmer traditional dances, traditional Khmer instruments, and regional Dance at the Preah Vihear Temple to welcome all the runners after they finish their run at the temple and to celebrate our World Heritage site of Preah Vihear Temple together.

**Total participants: approximately 1000 people**
